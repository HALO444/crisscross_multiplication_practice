# What Is Crisscross Multiplication?
Crisscross multiplication is a mental math method often used in Vedic Math to multiply large numbers quickly without traditional long multiplication.
It breaks the multiplication process into parts, working from left to right in a pattern that “crisscrosses” between digits.
The method focuses on breaking numbers down into digits and multiplying them in a cross pattern, then adding partial results to get the final answer.
It’s known for speed, pattern recognition, and being useful in mental calculation.
